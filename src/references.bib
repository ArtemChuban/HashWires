                from her bank, without revealing her age. She therefore needs a
                tool for proving that a committed number lies in a specific
                interval. Up to now, such tools were either inefficient (too many
                bits to compute and to transmit) or inexact (i.e. proved
                membership to a much larger interval). This paper presents a new
                proof, which is both efficient and exact. Here, ``efficient''
                means that there are less than 20 exponentiations to perform and
                less than 2 Kbytes to transmit. The potential areas of
                application of this proof are numerous (electronic cash, group
                signatures, publicly verifiable secret encryption, etc ...).",

    abstract = {Bitcoin exchanges function like banks, securely holding
                customers' bitcoins on their behalf. Several exchanges have
                suffered catastrophic losses with customers permanently losing
                their savings. A proof of solvency demonstrates cryptographically
                that the exchange controls sufficient reserves to settle each
                customer's account. We introduce Provisions, a privacy-preserving
                proof of solvency whereby an exchange does not have to disclose
                its Bitcoin addresses; total holdings or liabilities; or any
                information about its customers. We also propose an extension
                which prevents exchanges from colluding to cover for each other's
                losses. We have implemented Provisions and it offers practical
                computation times and proof sizes even for a large Bitcoin
                exchange with millions of customers.},
