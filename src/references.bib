    abstract = {Fog Computing, which has the advantage of both the Cloud
                Computing and the Internet of Things, has changed our daily
                lives. One important property of the Fog Computing is location
                awareness. To guarantee this property in a practical hostile
                environment, location verification protocols are always desired.
                However, few location verification protocols can protect the
                location privacy of the location prover, who attempts to prove
                that he or she is at some position or in some region. Even worse,
                to the best of our knowledge, no location verification protocol
                has considered how to protect the location privacy against the
                verifiers of the protocol, who verify whether the prover is
                telling the truth. In this paper, we solve this problem by giving
                constructions of secure positioning protocol with location
                privacy in the bounded retrieval model. More precisely, we first
                explore how to define location privacy, which requires that
                nearly all parties except the prover, including verifiers and
                outside attackers, cannot learn any additional information about
                the exact position of the prover, for secure positioning protocol
                in the bounded retrieval model. Then we illustrate how to
                construct protocols satisfying this definition. In particular, we
                present a construction in the one-dimension setting, which
                explains the basic idea of our construction, and a construction
                in the three-dimensions setting, which can capture most practical
                scenarios. Amazingly, privacy is achieved without introducing
                additional computation overhead, and our system is as efficient
                as the one constructed in Chandran et al. (CRYPTO 2009). Besides,
                based on our proposed secure positioning protocols with location
                privacy, we also build more advanced cryptographic protocols
                exploiting location verification, e.g., position based key
                exchange, position based multi-party computation, position based
                public key infrastructure, etc., all of which still preserve the
                location privacy. Finally, we also give a proof of concept
                implementation of our system, which demonstrates that our system
                is quite practical in practice.},

                ultrasonic or radio, based on received signal strength or signal
                time of flight. Through several examples we show how this
                approach can be used to secure nodecentric and

    abstract = {With the growing prevalence of sensor and wireless networks
                comes a new demand for location-based access control mechanisms.
                We introduce the concept of secure location verification, and we
                show how it can be used for location-based access control. Then,
                we present the Echo protocol, a simple method for secure location
                verification. The Echo protocol is extremely lightweight: it does
                not require time synchronization, cryptography, or very precise
                clocks. Hence, we believe that it is well suited for use in small
                , cheap, mobile devices.},
